Powered by Mapbox and Västtrafik public API. 
Renders coordinates from all live vehichles from Västtrafik Public transport fleet onto an interactive map. 
This is a minimal working product. The intention is to find a better solution to stream the ever changing coordinates from the API to render the live positions more smoothly.
